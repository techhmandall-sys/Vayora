--
-- A passenger who was offered another ride as well would have asked for a ride anyway,
-- so only an only-option refill can be a booking that would otherwise not exist.
-- refills_only_option is therefore an upper bound on bookings added by released seats.
-- It is not the number added: the ride may have had other free seats too.
--
-- A booking is matched to the answer its own search got by search id and instant, since
-- a repeat search reuses the search id. Matching is by grouping, not joining: the keys
-- live inside the payload, where a join has no statistics to plan with.

-- Seats on a ride are interchangeable, so a refill cannot be tied to one release. This is

-- more before departure), and rides whose releases were all late. Rides with both, and
