# Decisions

The decisions that shape VAYORA, each with the reason it was made and what it costs. Each
was recorded when it was made, in PROGRESS.md; this file gathers them by subject. A
decision listed here is to be changed on purpose, not by accident: change it here first.

The rules in CLAUDE.md (frozen parameters, the architecture rule, data placement, the
research integrity rules) are the project's own and are not repeated. Everything below
was decided while building within them.

## Research

| Decision | Why | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| The primary metric is completed rides per 100 searches, every other number secondary | CLAUDE.md fixes it; bookings can rise while rides do not | A variant that only moves cancellations earlier scores nothing, which is what happened |
| Cox proportional hazards is the served model | Best departure Brier score and concordance of the three fitted | Its proportional-hazards assumption is violated for lead time |
| The gradient-boosted survival model trains on a 5,000-row sample | Its loss is quadratic in rows; the full set ran for over ten minutes | It is compared on less data than Cox |
| Corridor demand is not calibrated (feature 89 left not started, 2026-10-21) | No real demand figures for the corridor exist; a proxy from public bus and train timetables was offered and declined, since it would not be calibration | Every result rests on demand the authors assumed |
| Variants B1 and B2 are not built | The simulated corridor has one origin and one destination: there is no geography to filter or rank two-sidedly | Two rungs of the ladder are missing |
| B5 keeps B4's threshold and adds only a budget | So the two differ in one thing | |
| The share of passengers with a flexible booking is swept, never assumed | Nothing in a simulation says how many would choose it | The result is a range, not one number |
| The simulator's setting is `flexible_booking`, not `flexible` | `flexible` is already a hidden passenger type, which must never be confused with anything observable | |
| The contact scheduler is a CP-SAT integer programme | A seat limit per departure day makes the choice one that sorting cannot solve | A dependency (OR-Tools) for a constraint that rarely binds at this scale |
| A sweep can vary a variant's parameters, not only the world's | The budget is a property of the variant | |
| Metric queries group rather than join on keys inside the JSON payload | A join on payload keys did not finish in ten minutes; grouping takes seconds | Queries are longer to read |
| SOS presses and seat holds write no event | The 22-event vocabulary is frozen and neither is a research measurement | They cannot be analysed from the log |
| A request closed for want of an answer is logged as `booking_rejected` by the platform, with a reason | Tells a lapse from a driver's refusal without a new event type | Queries must read the actor to tell them apart |
| The public hotel bookings are written into the event log under a run of their own | Every reported number must come from `metrics.sql` over `events`; one query then counts the hotels and the simulator the same way | Rows in `events` that are not VAYORA's; every query already selects by run |
| The hotel survival check trains on 2015 and 2016 arrivals and checks on 2017 | Years are that data's seeds; a later year tests the models on bookings they could not have seen | 2015 is only half a year |
| Its features are only what is known when a booking is made | Anything changed later would carry the future into the prediction | A refundable deposit is left out too: it separates outcomes |
| A Cox fit that does not converge stops the run | lifelines' default steps stop early on these data, and a fit that has not converged is not a result | Fit settings live in the config |
| Hotel dates are read as noon UTC | The data has days only; a real time zone would move some intervals by an hour at summer time | Day 0 is a calendar day for the hotels and 24 hours in the simulator |
| The hotel file is downloaded and checked by hash, not committed | 16 MB of someone else's data; the hash makes any copy provably the same | Reproducing needs a network the first time |
| A live what-if run is simulated by intel, which the administrator's browser calls | It keeps nothing, so by the placement rule it is intel's; core-api relaying it would forward a request for another | intel answers browsers on that path and checks tokens itself; the deployment must expose only that path |
| A live run gives means, the mean paired difference and seeds up and down, but no interval | It is an exploration, not a result; an interval would need scipy in intel and would look like a report figure | A small difference can be over-read; a sweep gives the interval |
| Each sweep says in its YAML how far a live run may take its setting | Bounds are tunables (rule 5); outside them a run may mean nothing or take long | A sweep with no bounds is not offered live |
| A live run builds its cell with the sweeps' own code (`sim.config.apply_cell`) | So a live run at a value a sweep covered reproduces it exactly, which a test checks | |

## Platform: correctness

| Decision | Why | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| The seat-release reminder asks only bookings the model rates below 0.8, within a budget the contact scheduler fills (from 2026-10-20; from 2026-10-17, everyone alike) | Chosen by the team, so the research's targeted intervention runs on the platform as the simulator's B5 | The reason it was first untargeted still stands: it acts on a guess about a real person, from a model trained on simulated data that ranks weakly. Only a neutral message rests on it, and the simulator found targeting adds no rides |
| The reminder states the refund the passenger would get at that moment | At 48 hours the whole-fare tier is ending; promising it would mislead | The figure is 50% for most who read it later |
| JdbcTemplate with hand-written SQL, no ORM | The existing code used it, and taking seats is one conditional `UPDATE` that reads more plainly without an ORM | More SQL to maintain |
| Seats are counted per leg of a ride | A passenger on one stretch must not take a seat from another stretch | Every booking touches several rows |
| Booking locks the ride row, then takes all legs in one conditional update | Concurrent requests for the last seat must produce exactly one booking | Bookings on one ride are serialised |
| Payment is held in the same transaction as the booking | A declined payment leaves no booking and no seat taken, and no hold-expiry machinery is needed | A slow provider would hold the ride lock |
| The money ledger and the audit log cannot be rewritten, enforced by database triggers | So the application cannot quietly correct history | Mistakes are fixed by new entries only |
| A seat hold lives only in Redis and never changes PostgreSQL's counts | No entity in two stores, and nothing to keep in step | A hold is a courtesy: it is not honoured while Redis is down |
| An unanswered request closes after 12 hours or 2 hours before boarding | So seats and money are not tied up until the ride leaves | A driver who answers late finds it gone |
| A ride, its return and its weekly repeats are published in one transaction | A driver is never left with half a series | Each is still a ride of its own, with no series-wide edit |

## Platform: money

| Decision | Why | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| With Razorpay a payment is captured when the booking or pass is made, and a release is a refund | The ledger's hold, capture and release map onto it without keeping authorisations past the few days Razorpay allows | A refund takes days to reach a card |
| A Razorpay payment is refunded in full if the booking or pass it paid for rolls back, whatever the reason | Whatever undoes the purchase must undo the payment | A refund that then fails is logged for a person to settle |
| The amount of a checkout is the server's, and the booking checks it was paid in full | The browser must not set its own price | One more request before paying |
| One payment pays for one booking or one pass, checked under a lock and by a unique index | A signed payment could otherwise be presented twice | |
| With Razorpay a booking is for this ride only | A flexible rebooking needs a payment the passenger is not there to make | Flexible tiers are off while Razorpay is |
| Drivers are not paid through Razorpay | Paying out needs its separate payouts product and drivers' bank details | A payout is recorded, not sent, and the earnings page says so |
| A test key is recorded as RAZORPAY_TEST | Every intent, receipt and screen then says that no real money moved | |
| The only payment provider is a mock, and every screen and receipt says so | The project must not claim money moves | Nothing is tested against a real gateway |
| The service fee is kept once a driver has accepted; returned in full if the driver declines, never answers or cancels | The platform did its part once the driver accepted | |
| The fare a late-cancelling passenger forfeits goes to the driver | The seat was held for them | |
| A travel pass waives only the service fee | Drivers set fares; the only price the platform can discount is its own fee | A pass is worth 10% of fares, which may be too little to be attractive |
| Refund terms and booking deadlines are fetched from the server, not repeated in the app | One source of truth | One more request per page |
| Receipts are not tax invoices | The platform handles no GST | |
| A referral earns each passenger of the pair a free weekly pass, once, when the invited member completes a first trip | The pass is the platform's own fee to give away; a first trip, not a sign-up, so fake accounts earn nothing | Drivers earn nothing, as passes are worth nothing to them |
| Commitment pricing lowers the passenger's service fee on a reliable driver's ride, and never raises anything | Drivers keep the whole fare, so the only price the platform can move is its own fee; the project's rules forbid pricing on predicted risk and punitive prices | The platform gives up 3 points of fee on those rides; a new driver cannot earn it until they have 10 completed rides |
| "Keeps their rides" means at least 10 completed and none withdrawn among rides due to leave in the last 90 days or later | Observed behaviour only, simple enough to explain on the result | A withdrawal for good reason costs the driver the same as any other |

## Platform: identity, trust and safety

| Decision | Why | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Texts go through Twilio when its three settings are set, to the simulated outbox otherwise | Its API is plain HTTP, and its test credentials allow a try that sends nothing and costs nothing | Real texts to Indian numbers need DLT registration, not done |
| The emergency button texts each contact on its own and records those it missed | A real text can fail; an alert must never fail because of one, and the member must know whom to call | A missed text is reported, not retried |
| Insurance is the driver's declaration, shown as such, with no policy number kept | No insurer is connected, so nothing can be checked; a policy number would be personal data for no purpose | A passenger has only the driver's word |
| A masked call is allowed only between confirmed numbers, from 24 hours before boarding while the booking is confirmed, and the other side is told | A real relay must never ring a number nobody proved | |
| Repeated masked calls are not limited (2026-10-21) | Chosen by the team when a review raised it | With Twilio on, someone can ring the other side again and again, at two paid legs a call |
| With Twilio, a masked call is a bridge: the caller is rung from the platform's number, then the other side is dialled from it | Neither ever sees the other's number, and Twilio's ordinary call API does it with no number pool | Two paid legs per call; untried. Without Twilio the call is simulated and says so |
| One role per account: passenger, driver or administrator | Simpler permissions | A person cannot be both passenger and driver |
| Administrators cannot sign up; they are created from configuration | So nobody can make themselves one | |
| Another member's booking, ride or contact answers 404, not 403 | Ids cannot be probed | Debugging is a little harder |
| Suspension is checked on every request | A token cannot be recalled before it expires | One extra query per request |
| A report needs a booking shared with the member reported | Strangers cannot file against each other | |
| "Confirmed", never "verified", for an email or phone proved by code | A code proves an address, not a person | |
| Confirmation codes are stored as hashes, expire in 10 minutes, work once, die after 5 wrong guesses; one a minute and ten a day per channel (the daily cap from 2026-10-24) | Codes are credentials. The wait alone allowed 1,440 codes a day, each with five guesses | |
| Wrong passwords are counted per email address or phone number, in Redis, for 15 minutes from the first; five lock that address's password sign-in until the window ends (from 2026-10-24) | A count that expires is ephemeral, like a seat hold, so it is Redis's and in no other store; counting per address stops guessing one password from any number of machines, and needs no trust in forwarded client addresses. The key is a digest, so no address is copied out of PostgreSQL. Google sign-in is not counted: nothing in it can be guessed | Anyone can lock a member's password sign-in for 15 minutes; one client can still try a few passwords on each of many addresses. Without Redis nothing is counted, so an outage stops nobody signing in |
| Women-only rides rest on the gender a member declares, which nobody checks | It is the only information the platform has | The rule can be got round by anyone willing to lie |
| Experience levels need a confirmed email from the second level and a confirmed phone from the fourth | Levels should reward what can be checked, however weakly | The thresholds are assumptions |
| Gender is used but never shown | It decides women-only access; it is not other members' business | |
| The emergency panel puts calling 112 before alerting VAYORA | VAYORA is not an emergency service, and its messages are simulated | |
| Durability scores are shown to administrators only | A prediction about a person must not change how they are treated by other members | |
| Predicted risk never cancels a booking or changes a price | The project's own rules forbid treating a prediction as proof of intent | The intervention can only ask |

## Platform: search and routing

| Decision | Why | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| A rickshaw fare is given only where a published fare says both how far its minimum goes and the rate after | A fare worked out from half a rule would be a guess shown as a price | Kolhapur, where the corridor starts, gets a time but no fare |
| A rickshaw's time is the car route's | It is the only road time the platform has; an auto-rickshaw's pace in traffic is unknown | Labelled an estimate, it may still read as too quick |
| Search is by location; town names are presets for coordinates | Passengers rarely start at a stop | A straight-line access limit, not a walking distance |
| The 5 km access distance is a hard limit | A far-away ride ranked low is still not one a passenger can take | |
| A road route unavailable from OSRM is drawn as straight lines and labelled so | A straight-line estimate must never pass for a road distance | |
| A filter only ever narrows a search | Predictability | |
| Smoking and pets filters leave out drivers who have not said | Silence is not a promise | Today they leave out nearly everyone |
| Search positions are rounded to about 100 m in the event log | Research needs the area, not the doorstep | |
| A driver's detour allowance is one total for the ride, spent pickup by pickup | A driver cares how late they arrive, not how the minutes are split | One far pickup can use up the allowance for everyone after |
| A pickup is weighed again by road at booking, just before the ride lock, and checked against the minutes left under it | The search's figure could be stale, and two passengers must not both spend the last minutes; a slow routing service must not hold the lock, and the cost depends on nothing it protects | One more routing call per booking |
| Pickups only, not drop-offs | Half the work for the case that matters most: getting to a ride is the hard part | A passenger still walks from the last stop |
| Match scoring uses only what both people said, distance, price and the driver's record of rides kept | Ranking real people by a model's guess about them is not done anywhere on the platform | It knows nothing about people who leave their profile empty |
| A preference either person left unsaid counts half | Silence should neither help nor hurt | Saying nothing scores the same as half agreeing |
| "Best match" is one order among five, not the default | A passenger should be able to see results by time without a score in the way | |
| A ride under way is sold only from a stop it is due at 30 minutes or more ahead, by its timetable or by its actual start if that was earlier | The timetable and the start are all core-api knows of a ride's progress; live position is the gateway's and is not kept as truth. A ride may start up to an hour early | A ride that gains time on the road can still beat a late booker to the stop; the margin is in `application.yml` |
| A ride under way is sold only if it confirms instantly | A driver at the wheel must not be answering requests | Rides that need approval lose these seats |
| A no-show gives the seat back | The seat is empty for the rest of the ride, and an empty seat refilled is the project's whole idea | The no-show passenger has still paid, so the seat may earn twice |
| A booking on a ride under way writes `trip_started` when it is made | Every `trip_completed` or `trip_failed` must have a start, and there is no boarding event | Its start is when it was booked, not when the passenger got in |

## Interface

| Decision | Why | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| An iOS-style look, light, dark or matching the device as the reader chooses in the header, VAYORA teal as the tint (2026-10-22, as the team chose) | Every colour class reads a CSS variable, so one set of dark values restyles every screen; the shared components carry the rest | |
| Each role in its own tint: passengers teal, drivers indigo, administrators violet | A person always knows which side of the platform they are on | The brand colour is the passengers' only |
| Entrances in CSS; exits, height changes and drag in Framer Motion (`framer-motion`) | CSS cannot animate an element leaving the page, a height to "auto", or a swipe | One more dependency, about 110 KB, in its own cached file |
| Icons from `lucide-react` | One consistent set, each icon imported on its own | One more dependency |
| Each screen is its own chunk, loaded when opened and fetched ahead when its link is pointed at | The first page arrives sooner; the build no longer warns of a 700 KB bundle | A screen opened for the first time on a slow line shows a shimmer briefly |
| English text is the translation key, and tests fail if a string lacks Hindi or Marathi | A missing translation is caught by the build, and still shows English rather than nothing | The English wording cannot change without the tables |
| Money and times use the same digits in every language | Passenger and driver read the same fare | |
| A chat message is shown when the gateway relays it, not when it is typed | What a sender sees is what everyone received | |
| Irreversible actions need a second, explicit press | Cancelling, completing and marking a no-show cannot be undone | One more click |
| The PDF receipt is in English | The PDF's built-in fonts cover Latin script only | Devanagari names print as "?" in it |
| A receipt in Hindi or Marathi is a page in the app that the browser prints or saves as PDF (from 2026-10-21) | The browser already has fonts that shape Devanagari; PDFBox does not shape it, and embedding fonts would add files and licences | Two forms of one receipt. Both come from one query, so they cannot disagree on the facts |
| Flexibility tiers are a time window, chosen by the passenger | The team's choice: the passenger agrees in advance to be moved, and the price never changes, so nothing is priced or decided on a prediction about them. "Hazard-informed" means only that Flexible is suggested on a driver whose own record shows withdrawals | A rebooked passenger may land on a ride the driver approves, so they hold a request, not a seat |
| A rebooking runs after the withdrawal commits, in its own transaction | So a rebooking that fails cannot undo the withdrawal or anyone's refund. Found in testing: a notification sent from an after-commit step must have its own transaction too, or it waits for a commit that has already happened and is never written | |
| Email goes through any SMTP server, chosen by configuration | No particular provider is assumed; text messages stay simulated. Each channel reports separately whether it really sends, so the SOS record stays honest when email is real and SMS is not | |
| Photos are kept in PostgreSQL | CLAUDE.md allows no third data store, and a photo belongs to the member or vehicle it shows. Each is a small re-encoded JPEG | The database grows with them; there is no CDN, and every view goes through core-api |
| Web Push written with the JDK, not a library | The protocol is three small pieces of standard cryptography; the libraries for it bring their own HTTP client and crypto provider. Checked against RFC 8291's example to the byte | Code to maintain that a library would have kept up to date |
| Google sign-in uses Google's ID token, checked by core-api | No server-side redirect flow and no client secret to keep; the browser gets a signed token and core-api verifies it with the JWT library it already uses | Needs Google's script on the sign-in pages, loaded only when a client ID is set |
| Supply gaps are read from the event log; nudges are few and plain | Searches and their results are already logged, so no new table. A nudge says only what passengers looked for, goes to drivers who drove the stretch, and is limited to one a week per driver and five per gap (all in `application.yml`) | `nudge_converted` shows only that a driver later offered the stretch, not that the nudge caused it; it is never reported as a result |
| Server error messages are translated by the app, not the server | The server stays in one language and the app already keys its tables by the English; a core-api test keeps the two lists in step | The server's wording cannot change without the app's tables |
| Web pushes stay in English (2026-10-21) | Translating them would need the background worker to carry the tables and know the reader's language: a build step for text that links to the notifications page, which is translated | A push in a Hindi or Marathi reader's browser is in English |
| A server error built from values is matched by the app against a template, such as "You can have at most {n} emergency contacts" (from 2026-10-21) | The API's messages stay as they were, and a core-api test fails if the server builds one the app has no template for | A booking status inside one is a code (`CANCELLED`), which the app turns into a word |
| A date or time inside a notification is written as ISO-8601 (from 2026-10-21) | The server's English renders it as before, so copies read the same, and the app shows it in the reader's language | A value that is exactly an ISO instant is always read as a moment |
| Notifications are stored as a template and its values | So the app can show them in the reader's language; the English is rendered from the same template, so copies and older notifications read as before. A core-api test reads the web app's list, so a template the app cannot translate fails the build | Every new notification needs its template added to the web app and translated |
| A front page for signed-out visitors, in the main bundle (from 2026-10-24) | `/` used to send everyone to the sign-in form, which says nothing about what VAYORA is; every claim on the page is one the code makes good, and its footer says what is simulated | About 10 KB more in the first download |
| Installable, with an offline page and no other caching (from 2026-10-24) | A phone can keep VAYORA on its home screen; a page that cannot load says so in all three languages instead of the browser's error. Caching the app itself would risk serving a stale build against a newer API | Nothing works offline beyond that one page |
| A command palette (Ctrl+K) beside the navigation, not instead of it (from 2026-10-24) | Fast for anyone at a keyboard, and invisible to everyone else | |
| Dark maps are OpenStreetMap's tiles inverted and hue-rotated, not a dark tile provider (from 2026-10-24) | No second map provider to agree terms with or send readers' addresses to | Colours are approximate: parks and water keep their hue only roughly |
| The what-if page shows saved sweeps; it runs nothing | Running the simulator from a screen needs a service to run it: intel holds no state and core-api owns transactions, and a fourth runtime is ruled out. The web image is built from `web/` alone, so `export_web.py` copies the sweep figures into `web/src/data/whatif.json`, and `reproduce.sh` and a test fail if the copy drifts | Only settings already swept can be chosen; a new question needs a sweep run by hand |

## Dependencies

Each was justified in one sentence when it was added, as CLAUDE.md requires.

| Dependency | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| OR-Tools | intel, research | CP-SAT for the contact scheduler |
| Apache PDFBox | core-api | Writes receipts; tests read them back |
| lifelines, scikit-survival | research only | Fitting the survival models; serving needs neither |
| Leaflet, react-leaflet | web | Maps for routes and meeting points |
| socket.io-client | web | Chat and live position |
| matplotlib | research only | Draws the report's figures from the committed results |
| SimPy, PyYAML | intel (already research) | Run the simulator and read its configurations for a live what-if run |
| PyJWT | intel, research | intel checks an administrator's token for a live what-if run, as the gateway does; the tests sign the tokens they present |
| framer-motion, lucide-react | web | Exits, height changes and swipes that CSS cannot animate; one consistent icon set (see Interface) |
| ESLint, typescript-eslint, eslint-plugin-react-hooks, eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y | web, gateway (development only) | Catch misused hooks, unused code and accessibility faults that the type checker and the tests do not |
| springdoc-openapi | core-api | Generates the API's OpenAPI description and Swagger UI from the controllers, so the reference cannot drift from the code |

Tailwind stays on version 3 (2026-10-24). Version 4 would clear the last three moderate
advisories, but they are in build tools that only ever parse the project's own CSS, and
version 4 needs Safari 16.4, Chrome 111 or Firefox 128 or later: older phones, common
among the passengers the corridor serves, would get an unstyled app.
